Explore and learn about the Earth&amp;rsquo;s astronomy, both from space and from the Earth&amp;rsquo;s surface.
Why do we have seasons? Is it true that the Sun only rises once a year at the North Pole? What is a tropic? What happens during a solar eclipse? You can get answers to these questions and many more in the app&amp;rsquo;s many guides. Astronomical concepts are explained pedagogically step by step with various interactive elements that deepen the understanding.</description></item><item><title>2</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/seasons/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/seasons/</guid><description/></item><item><title>3</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/ar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/ar/</guid><description/></item><item><title>4</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/guides/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2020 14:39:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/features/guides/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Privacy Policy</title><link>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/privacy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://oversizedhat.github.io/spacentime-homepage-stage/privacy/</guid><description>Privacy Policy Hi!
